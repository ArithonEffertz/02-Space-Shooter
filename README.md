# Project Name
2D Space Shooter

A standard 2D Space Shooter involving a one on one with a dangerous enemy.

## Implementation
Built using Godot 3.2.2

## References
None

## Future Development
It would be beneficial if the code that I implemented from other projects blended well with each other. I had code in there for the falling enemies but none showed up and the one enemy I did have worked perfectly until I tried adding a HUD, a main menu and other enemies.
